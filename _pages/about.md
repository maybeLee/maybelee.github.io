I am a fifth-year PhD student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by Prof. [Shing-Chi Cheung](http://home.cse.ust.hk/faculty/scc/). 
I also had an unforgettable visiting experience at UIUC under the supervision of Prof. [Lingming Zhang](http://lingming.cs.illinois.edu).
I received my bachelor's degree at [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). 
My research interest is large language model-driven software testing / program analysis.
Currently I am working on testing and analyzing deep learning libraries including TensorFlow and PyTorch.
